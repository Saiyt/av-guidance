# NEW SECTION Liability
- For any civil claim which ocurrs with a vehicle operating at SAE level 3 as certified by the manufacturer or the Department of Licensing, any party to an action based on the incident may establish a rebuttable presumption that the autonomous function of the vehicle was the proximate cause of the claim. The presumption may be established by showing by a preponderance of the evidence the following items:
    1. The autonomous functionality of the vehicle was engaged at the time the claim arose; 
    2. Any of the owner, operator, or other responsible party reasonably maintained the vehicle's autonomous driving components in accordance with applicable state law and manufacturer guidelines. 
Once such showing has been made, the manufacturer, upfitter, or other party which affixed and made available autonomous driving funcitonality to the vehicle operator may be joined in the action.
