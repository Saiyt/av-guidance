Privacy Requirements


Prior to publicly deploying an Autonomous Vehicle for sale or as a transportation service, the manufacturer/operator will submit to the Washington Chief Privacy Officer a report, to be updated every two years thereafter, of compliance detailing company efforts to implement the following state interests:


- User Notice and Consent- provide users with clear notification indicating the types of information collected, what information is shared outside the vehicle, and instructions on how to modify privacy settings.


- Data Security - implement hardware and software at a level representing a “best-practice” in the industry. Limit access to data on an “as-needed” basis.


- 3rd Party Data Sharing- distinctly inform users of any parties, other than the manufacturer/operator, who have access to information collected by their AV. Also indicate whether this information is being purchased.


- Contextual Use - use data only for purposes previously agreed to by the user.


- User Choice - provide users with meaningful opportunity to operate AVs ranging from bare transportation functionality to more enhanced personalization.


- “Critical Incident Recorder” File- provide user/relevant parties with means for exporting event log of sensor information before/after accident or other critical incident in a generally used file format.


- Breach Report and Notification - implement a data-breach response plan 

The Chief Privacy Officer shall publish all reports online for public viewing within 90 days of receipt. The Chief Privacy Officer shall review and issue annual recommendations to the legislature identifying any recommended statutory updates. 




Agency Delegation

- Washington State Department of Licensing - determine what level of license is required to be an “occupant in charge” of an AV depending on SAE level. Also create a “fleet operator” license and vehicle inspection requirements for application by ride-sharing AV businesses. Upon licensing a vehicle within the state, the DoL will provide a mandatory notice regarding the autonomous functions of the vehicle. Such notice could be provided to the seller of the vehicle or directly during licensing. 


- Department of Employment Security is charged with undertaking a study on effects and recommendations to address a reduction in “drivers” necessary to meet state transportation needs


- Department of Natural Resources is charged with undertaking a study of effects and recommendations on the environmental impact of AVs


- Traffic Safety Commission is charged with undertaking a study of effects and making recommendations on the integration of AVs into highly urban areas


- Department of Transportation is charged with compiling a list of necessary infrastructure upgrades to facilitate the safe integration of AVs into WA roadways


## ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES


Creation of the Committee. The Agency will create and launch the “Committee for Autonomous Technologies Safety and Cybersecurity” (CyberCATS). The Committee will include representatives from the governor’s office, the motor vehicle administration, the State department of transportation, the State law enforcement agency, the State Highway Safety Office, office of information technology, State insurance regulator, the State office(s) representing the aging and disabled communities, toll authorities, and transit authorities. [Need to check with Daniel what the name of these entities in WA are]

Coordination. The Agency will inform the CyberCATS about the requests received to test autonomous vehicles and the status of the Agency’s responses to them.

CyberCATS will work in conjunction with the chief of police and the department of transportation to establish a training program for police officers regarding training for enforcement issues relating to autonomous vehicles.

Better Regulation. The Agency will review main statutes to identify any legal issues that need to be addressed prior to the deployment and operation of automated vehicles. In particular, but not limited to, the Agency will examine the (1) licensing/registration; (2) driver education/training; (3) insurance and liability; (4) enforcement of traffic laws/regulations; and (5) administration of motor vehicle inspections, in order to address unnecessary barriers to safe testing, deployment, and operation of HAVs. [Need to see if we have to delegate all of these or if the rest of the team has dealt already with some of them]

Test Application Procedure. The Agency will define an internal procedure for the application of manufacturers to test autonomous vehicles in the State of Washington. 

Test Vehicle Permit Issuance Procedure. The motor vehicle agency will define an internal procedure for issuing test vehicle permits for autonomous vehicles.
