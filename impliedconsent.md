Notwithstanding the provisions of RCW 46.20.308 "Implied consent- Test refusal- Procedures", a person who rides in or seeks transportation in a vehicle designated to be an autonomous vehicle of SAE level 4 or greater shall not be deemed to have given implied consent to a breath test unless the arresting offer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person had disabled or failed to engage the autonomous functionality of the vehicle during that person's physical control of the vehicle.
