AN ACT Relating to the use of autonomous vehicles within the state of Washington; 
- adding a new chapter to TITLE 46;
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:The following definitions shall apply to all sections within this chapter.

- **Levels of Autonomy** - 

- **Autonomous Vehicle** - A motor vehicle which is equipped with a self-driving system. Any vehicle at or exceeding Level Three as established by the Society of American Engineers shall qualify as an autonomous vehicle. 
- **Self-driving system** - Artificial Intelligence system which is capable of functioning under conditions which require it to engage in the dynamic driving task. 
- **Driver** - Any person who engages a level 4 or higher AV capability shall not be considered a 'driver', 'operator', or 'in control of a vehicle'. Any person who engages a level 3 autonomous vehicle shall still be considered to be a driver, but only to the extent which they must be capable of resuming the dynamic driving task in situations for which the level 3 autonomous vehicle cannot sufficiently carry out the dynamic driving task. 
- **Operator** - Individual who engages the automated vehicle functionality
- **Testing** - Driving of an autonomous vehicle under supervision of a human operator that can take control of the vehicle immediately, manually or remotely.
- **Manufacturer** - A person or entity that has manufactured and distributed motor vehicles in the United States that is certified to comply with all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and that has submitted appropriate Manufacturer identification information to the NHTSA as provided in 49 CFR section 566. 
- **Upfitter** - An entity or person that modifies a motor vehicle after it was manufactured by installing a self-driving system in that motor vehicle to convert it to an autonomous vehicle
- **Physical Control** - as defined in the RCW
- **Dynamic Driving Task** - Use of sensory and motive capacity to engage, direct, and control a vehicle  whether through the use of eyes, hands, or technological means. # NEW SECTION Agency Delegation

- Washington State Department of Licensing - determine what level of license is required to be an “occupant in charge” of an AV depending on SAE level. Also create a “fleet operator” license and vehicle inspection requirements for application by ride-sharing AV businesses. Upon licensing a vehicle within the state, the DoL will provide a mandatory notice regarding the autonomous functions of the vehicle. Such notice could be provided to the seller of the vehicle or directly during licensing. 
- Department of Employment Security is charged with undertaking a study on effects and recommendations to address a reduction in “drivers” necessary to meet state transportation needs
- Department of Natural Resources is charged with undertaking a study of effects and recommendations on the environmental impact of AVs
- Traffic Safety Commission is charged with undertaking a study of effects and making recommendations on the integration of AVs into highly urban areas
- Department of Transportation is charged with compiling a list of necessary infrastructure upgrades to facilitate the safe integration of AVs into WA roadways


## ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES


Creation of the Committee. The Agency will create and launch the “Committee for Autonomous Technologies Safety and Cybersecurity” (CyberCATS). The Committee will include representatives from the governor’s office, the motor vehicle administration, the State department of transportation, the State law enforcement agency, the State Highway Safety Office, office of information technology, State insurance regulator, the State office(s) representing the aging and disabled communities, toll authorities, and transit authorities. [Need to check with Daniel what the name of these entities in WA are]

Coordination. The Agency will inform the CyberCATS about the requests received to test autonomous vehicles and the status of the Agency’s responses to them.

CyberCATS will work in conjunction with the chief of police and the department of transportation to establish a training program for police officers regarding training for enforcement issues relating to autonomous vehicles.

Better Regulation. The Agency will review main statutes to identify any legal issues that need to be addressed prior to the deployment and operation of automated vehicles. In particular, but not limited to, the Agency will examine the (1) licensing/registration; (2) driver education/training; (3) insurance and liability; (4) enforcement of traffic laws/regulations; and (5) administration of motor vehicle inspections, in order to address unnecessary barriers to safe testing, deployment, and operation of HAVs. [Need to see if we have to delegate all of these or if the rest of the team has dealt already with some of them]

Test Application Procedure. The Agency will define an internal procedure for the application of manufacturers to test autonomous vehicles in the State of Washington. 

Test Vehicle Permit Issuance Procedure. The motor vehicle agency will define an internal procedure for issuing test vehicle permits for autonomous vehicles.# NEW SECTION Deployed Vehicles

# av-guidance
Autonomous Vehicle Guidance
Set of legislative principles that recommend best practices for the regulation of autonomous vehicles. Any set of information published here is considered "stable" or definitions that are both *reviewed and consistent*.

Issues, concerns, and questions should be raised in the issue tracker: https://github.com/Saiyt/av-guidance/issues

GitHub uses the concept of branches to differentiate between different qualities of work. Our project will have two branches: [development](https://github.com/Saiyt/av-guidance/tree/development) and [master](https://github.com/Saiyt/av-guidance/tree/master).

Development represents the guidance that has not been reviewed by other members of the group. I will post changes to the development branch and merge them into the master branch. These should be considered "first draft."

Master represents our "final" draft, or at least the draft that the group agrees is representative of our work product and is ready for general consumption.

If you want to learn a new technology I'm happy to give you a quick tutorial and you're welcome to submit pull requests directly, otherwise don't worry about it. Just send your drafts to me directly and I'll take care of the administrative details. I know that this might seem a bit excessive. I believe that there are two major advantages to this approach. The first is that a great number of open source projects use these processes to manage complex details. Second, this process will give us a rich history of the work so that we can revert, change, and comment on each detail independently to promote a better finished project.

Thank you everyone for your hard work, I think this will go great!# NEW SECTION Testing
