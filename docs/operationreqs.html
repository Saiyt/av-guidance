Repeatedly failing to follow state laws will result in a suspension of testing permit</p>
<h2>Deployed Vehicles</h2>
<h3>Drivers</h3>
<p>For SAE Levels 2 and below:
The (agency/manufacturer/reseller) shall provide the operator with information about the levels of automation for specific vehicles, if any.
The operator shall understand their responsibilities for each level of automation</p>
<h3>Licensing</h3>

<p>Delegation
In order to make the transition from human-driven motor vehicles equipped with automated safety technologies to fully automated vehicles, gaps in current regulations should be identified and addressed by the States (with the assistance of NHTSA). Some examples are: • Law enforcement/emergency response • Occupant safety • Motor vehicle insurance • Crash investigations/crash reporting • Liability (tort, criminal, etc.) • Motor vehicle safety inspections • Education and training • Vehicle modifications and maintenance • Environmental impacts
[Need to see if we have to delegate all of these or if the rest of the team has dealt already with some of them]</p>
<h2>ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES</h2>
<p>Creation of the Committee. The Agency will create and launch the “Committee for Autonomous Technologies Safety and Cybersecurity” (CyberCATS). The Committee will include representatives from the governor’s office, the motor vehicle administration, the State department of transportation, the State law enforcement agency, the State Highway Safety Office, office of information technology, State insurance regulator, the State office(s) representing the aging and disabled communities, toll authorities, and transit authorities. [Need to check with Daniel what the name of these entities in WA are]</p>
<p>Coordination. The Agency will inform the CyberCATS about the requests received to test autonomous vehicles and the status of the Agency’s responses to them.</p>
<p>Better Regulation. The Agency will review main statutes to identify any legal issues that need to be addressed prior to the deployment and operation of automated vehicles. In particular, but not limited to, the Agency will examine the (1) licensing/registration; (2) driver education/training; (3) insurance and liability; (4) enforcement of traffic laws/regulations; and (5) administration of motor vehicle inspections, in order to address unnecessary barriers to safe testing, deployment, and operation of HAVs. [Need to see if we have to delegate all of these or if the rest of the team has dealt already with some of them]</p>
<p>Test Application Procedure. The Agency will define an internal procedure for the application of manufacturers to test autonomous vehicles in the State of Washington.</p>
<p>Test Vehicle Permit Issuance Procedure. The motor vehicle agency will define an internal procedure for issuing test vehicle permits for autonomous vehicles.</p>
