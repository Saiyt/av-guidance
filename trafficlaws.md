Any application of traffic laws to the operation of autonomous vehicles shall be constructed to afford the autonomous vehicle the same discretion which a reasonable human driver is afforded when faced with exigent circumstances. 

Such exigent circumstances include, but are not limited to obstructed roadways, allowances for pedestrians and bicyclists, and natural disasters.
