# Operation Requirements

## APPLYING FOR A TEST VEHICLE PERMIT
Agency = WA Department of Licensing/ Department of transportation?

A manufacturer or other entity that wants to test the vehicle on public roadways must submit an application to the Agency which may issue the test vehicle permit. The application must include:
- Statement that each vehicle follows NHTSA Performance guidance and complies with applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard.
- Identification of manufacturer or other entity and contact information of the testing program director.
- Vehicles’ identification to be tested on public roadways by VIN, vehicle type, and year, make, and model.
- Identification of the test operators with their driver’s license number, and respective jurisdiction.
- Safety and compliance plan, including self-certification of testing and compliance to NHTSA’s guidance (a copy of the summary Safety Assessment submitted to the NHTSA per the Vehicle Performance Guidance).
- Evidence of insurance, surety bond, or proof of self-insurance for 5 million US dollars.
- Summary of the operators’ training.
The Agency will grant testing approval when evidence of insurance, operator training, and self-certification.

## ISSUING PERMISSION TO TEST
Agency must involve the Department of Licensing and notify washington state patrol and relevant municipal police forces before granting permission of testing.
Permission can be granted with restrictions of testing in certain areas
Authorization may be suspended if the tester fails to … (any above requirements)
The Agency will issue a letter authorization of testing in the jurisdiction and the State motor vehicle agency a permit for each test vehicle.
The vehicle-specific permit must be carried in the test vehicle all the times
Vehicle properly registered and titled in accordance to WA laws.

### TESTING OPERATION
The vehicle can only be tested by an operator designated by the company.
The operator must hold a valid driving license in the US.
The operator must have received the proper training to manage the specific test vehicle.
The operator must be able to take immediate control of the vehicle, manually or remotely, in case of an emergency or malfunctioning of the vehicle.

All accidents with test vehicles must be reported in accordance to WA laws.

### Penalties
Failure to follow state operating procedures will result in a fine of up to $25,000 for each infraction
The state agency is responsible for issuing punishment
Repeatedly failing to follow state laws will result in a suspension of testing permit


## Deployed Vehicles


### Drivers
For SAE Levels 2 and below:
The (agency/manufacturer/reseller) shall provide the operator with information about the levels of automation for specific vehicles, if any. 
The operator shall understand their responsibilities for each level of automation


### Licensing
The operator must monitor the operation of the vehicle
The operator must be immediately available to perform the driving task when requested or the lower level automated system disengages

#### For SAE Level 3:
The operator is the individual who engages the autonomous driving capabilities of the vehicle
The operator must hold a valid driving license in Washington State
The operator shall be trained to safely operate the vehicle in autonomous driving mode
The operator is responsible for safe operation of the vehicle
The operator is required to follow traffic laws, except the following:
The operator does not need to keep their hands on the steering wheel of the vehicle.
The operator may use a cellular device as long as they do not undertake action which would restrict their ability to resume control within a reasonable period.

#### For SAE levels 4 and 5:
The operator is the individual who engages the autonomous driving capabilities of the vehicle
The operator does not need to be in the vehicle during operation
The operator is responsible for safe operation of the vehicle

The registrant shall acknowledge that they understand the operation requirements for the level of automation. 
The vehicle should have the autonomous capabilities identified on the title
When technology that allows a vehicle to be operated without a human driver either at all times or under limited circumstances is installed on a vehicle after the initial purchase, the vehicle shall need to get new registration and a new title
The new registration and title shall identify the level of automation according to SAE standards
For vehicles SAE levels 3 and above:
The vehicle shall have a sticker on the front and rear windshield/bumper that identifies the SAE level of automation

Operation
The operator must have insurance for the vehicle
The vehicle must be registered with the state before operation
The operator is responsible for following the traffic rules and of any traffic violation
All accidents with vehicles must be reported in accordance to WA laws.
Vehicle data pertaining to the accident must be made available to the state agency (kinda based this on apple’s letter)

Delegation
In order to make the transition from human-driven motor vehicles equipped with automated safety technologies to fully automated vehicles, gaps in current regulations should be identified and addressed by the States (with the assistance of NHTSA). Some examples are: • Law enforcement/emergency response • Occupant safety • Motor vehicle insurance • Crash investigations/crash reporting • Liability (tort, criminal, etc.) • Motor vehicle safety inspections • Education and training • Vehicle modifications and maintenance • Environmental impacts
[Need to see if we have to delegate all of these or if the rest of the team has dealt already with some of them]


## ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES


Creation of the Committee. The Agency will create and launch the “Committee for Autonomous Technologies Safety and Cybersecurity” (CyberCATS). The Committee will include representatives from the governor’s office, the motor vehicle administration, the State department of transportation, the State law enforcement agency, the State Highway Safety Office, office of information technology, State insurance regulator, the State office(s) representing the aging and disabled communities, toll authorities, and transit authorities. [Need to check with Daniel what the name of these entities in WA are]

Coordination. The Agency will inform the CyberCATS about the requests received to test autonomous vehicles and the status of the Agency’s responses to them.

Better Regulation. The Agency will review main statutes to identify any legal issues that need to be addressed prior to the deployment and operation of automated vehicles. In particular, but not limited to, the Agency will examine the (1) licensing/registration; (2) driver education/training; (3) insurance and liability; (4) enforcement of traffic laws/regulations; and (5) administration of motor vehicle inspections, in order to address unnecessary barriers to safe testing, deployment, and operation of HAVs. [Need to see if we have to delegate all of these or if the rest of the team has dealt already with some of them]

Test Application Procedure. The Agency will define an internal procedure for the application of manufacturers to test autonomous vehicles in the State of Washington. 

Test Vehicle Permit Issuance Procedure. The motor vehicle agency will define an internal procedure for issuing test vehicle permits for autonomous vehicles.
