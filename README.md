Autonomous Vehicle Guidance
Set of legislative principles that recommend best practices for the regulation of autonomous vehicles. Any set of information published here is considered "stable" or definitions that are both *reviewed and consistent*.

Issues, concerns, and questions should be raised in the issue tracker: https://github.com/Saiyt/av-guidance/issues

GitHub uses the concept of branches to differentiate between different qualities of work. Our project will have two branches: [development](https://github.com/Saiyt/av-guidance/tree/development) and [master](https://github.com/Saiyt/av-guidance/tree/master).

Development represents the guidance that has not been reviewed by other members of the group. I will post changes to the development branch and merge them into the master branch. These should be considered "first draft."

Master represents our "final" draft, or at least the draft that the group agrees is representative of our work product and is ready for general consumption.

If you want to learn a new technology I'm happy to give you a quick tutorial and you're welcome to submit pull requests directly, otherwise don't worry about it. Just send your drafts to me directly and I'll take care of the administrative details. I know that this might seem a bit excessive. I believe that there are two major advantages to this approach. The first is that a great number of open source projects use these processes to manage complex details. Second, this process will give us a rich history of the work so that we can revert, change, and comment on each detail independently to promote a better finished project.

Thank you everyone for your hard work, I think this will go great!
