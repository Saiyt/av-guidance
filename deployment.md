The vehicle should have the autonomous capabilities identified on the title
When technology that allows a vehicle to be operated without a human driver either at all times or under limited circumstances is installed on a vehicle after the initial purchase, the vehicle shall need to get new registration and a new title
The new registration and title shall identify the level of automation according to SAE standards

Vehicle data pertaining to the accident must be made available to the state agency (kinda based this on apple’s letter)

Delegation
In order to make the transition from human-driven motor vehicles equipped with automated safety technologies to fully automated vehicles, gaps in current regulations should be identified and addressed by the States (with the assistance of NHTSA). Some examples are: • Law enforcement/emergency response • Occupant safety • Motor vehicle insurance • Crash investigations/crash reporting • Liability (tort, criminal, etc.) • Motor vehicle safety inspections • Education and training • Vehicle modifications and maintenance • Environmental impacts
[Need to see if we have to delegate all of these or if the rest of the team has dealt already with some of them]
