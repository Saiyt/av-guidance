# NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. Definitions
The following definitions shall apply to all sections within this chapter.

- Autonomous Vehicle - A motor vehicle that is equipped with a self-driving system. Any vehicle at or exceeding - Level Three as established by the Society of American Engineers shall qualify as an autonomous vehicle. 
- Self-driving system - Artificial Intelligence system that is capable of functioning under conditions which require it to engage in the dynamic driving task. 
- Testing - Driving of an autonomous vehicle under supervision of a human operator that can take control of the vehicle immediately, manually or remotely.
- Autonomous Vehicle Manufacturer – Any individual or company that develops autonomous vehicles for testing or deployment purposes on public roadways; this shall include original equipment manufacturers, alterers, or modifiers;  
- Other Autonomous Vehicle Entity – is any individual or company that is not a manufacturer and is involved in any activity related to the manufacturing, testing, operation, selling, or renting of an autonomous vehicle
- Dynamic Driving Task - Use of sensory and motive capacity to engage, direct, and control a vehicle whether through the use of eyes, hands, or technological means. 
- Activator - Individual who activates the automated vehicle functionality
- "Operator or driver" means every person who drives or is in actual physical control of a vehicle provided that in regard to any vehicle whose self-driving system is rated as level four or higher and is properly engaged, the self-driving system shall be the driver and the self-driving system shall be considered the operator or driver of the vehicle.

## Levels of Automation

- Level Zero Autonomous Vehicle - the full-time performance by the human driver of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, even when enhanced by warning or intervention systems
- Level One Autonomous Vehicle - the driving mode-specific execution by a driver assistance system of either steering or acceleration/deceleration using information about the driving environment and with the expectation that the human driver perform all remaining aspects of the dynamic driving task
- Level Two Autonomous Vehicle - the driving mode-specific execution by one or more driver assistance systems of both steering and acceleration/ deceleration using information about the driving environment and with the expectation that the human driver perform all remaining aspects of the dynamic driving task
- Level Three Autonomous Vehicle - the driving mode-specific performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task with the expectation that the human driver will respond appropriately to a request to intervene
- Level Four Autonomous Vehicle - the driving mode-specific performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, even if a human driver does not respond appropriately to a request to intervene
- Level Five Autonomous Vehicle - the full-time performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task under all roadway and environmental conditions that can be managed by a human driver

# NEW SECTION Agency Delegations




## ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES


**The Committee.** The Transportation Commission will create and launch the “Committee for Autonomous Technologies Safety and Cybersecurity” (CyberCATS). The Committee shall include representatives from the Office of the Governor, the Department of Licensing, the State Department of Transportation, the Washington State Patrol, Washington Traffic Safety Commission, the Office of the Chief Information Officer, Washington State Office of the Insurance Commissioner, Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, tolling and transit authorities from the Washington Department of Transportation, among other representatives necessary for coordinating the testing and operating activities of the autonomous technology. CyberCATS should consult with representatives from related industries at regular intervals. 

**Information.** The Department of Licensing will inform the CyberCATS about the requests received to test autonomous vehicles and the status of the Department’s responses to them.
Data testing requirements. The Department of Licensing will define with the CyberCATS the necessary data from the entity to register an autonomous vehicle in Washington State. 

**Scope and Purpose**
Review of existing laws. CyberCATS will review main statutes to identify any legal issues that need to be addressed prior to the deployment and operation of automated vehicles and to ensure safe testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles. In particular, but not limited to, the licensing and registration procedures; driver information and training; the insurance and liability rules as well as the enforcement of traffic laws and motor vehicle inspections; requirements and needs of law enforcement related to autonomous vehicles; and whether a preclearance regime for the operation of autonomous vehicles should be adopted by Washington State.


CyberCATS shall coordinate with the following agencies to produce reports:
- Department of Employment Security is charged with undertaking a study on effects and recommendations to address a reduction in “drivers” necessary to meet state transportation needs
- Department of Natural Resources is charged with undertaking a study of effects and recommendations on the environmental impact of AVs
- Traffic Safety Commission is charged with undertaking a study of effects and making recommendations on the integration of AVs
- Department of Transportation is charged with compiling a list of necessary infrastructure upgrades to facilitate the safe integration of AVs into WA roadways


**Timing**
- The reports shall be produced and presented to the legislature within one year. 

**Additional Tasks**
At regular intervals, CyberCATS shall evaluate and determine additional related studies which need to be carried out for the effective administration of autonomous vehicles.
