# Executive Summary

The definitions used in the legislation mirror the definitions used by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in their autonomous vehicle policy. These definitions clarify terms used to describe autonomous vehicles and vehicle operators to avoid potential confusion with current driving legislation. Additionally, the levels of automation are defined according to the SAE International’s J3016 standard. These levels of automation describe categorical distinctions for a step-wise progress from level zero to level five automation.

# Narrative Explanation
Autonomous vehicles will be entering the marketplace at an increasing pace. States such as Michigan and Florida have taken the lead by promulgating regulations which attempt to regulate an evolving market. It is conceivable that an autonomous vehicle manufacturer could operate in Washington without regulation, but in the face of potential litigation during testing phases, certainty provides a substantial incentive.

## Framework

In order to provide the reassurance sought by consumers and the certainty sought by manufacturers, the legislation seeks to meet the following objectives:

- Delegate to competent state agencies
- Provide a legal framework for unexpected developments in technology
- Update statutes which do not account for autonomous operation
- Except in matter which autonomous vehicles necessarily differ from standard vehicles, the standard regime should apply. 

## Exclusion of Mandatory Manual Override

We decided to exclude a mandatory manual override requirement from the general operation requirements, though kept the requirement of an override (software or physical) for testing. 

We decided to exclude a mandatory manual override for the following reasons:
- Requires software to know that it is missing something and "prove the negative"
- Questionable whether humans have the requisite reaction time to respond appropriately in such situations. 
- Does not permit people of limited mobility to make use of the technology.

Furthermore, vehicles of level 3 or lower have an incentive to include a manual override already because the technology cannot be operated in a wide variety of known conditions, such that the vehicle would not be useful without some form of manual control.

For testing purposes, an override makes sense because the actual automation software has not necessarily proven it's capacity for directing that specific type of vehicle. In the short term, a human operator may provide a necessary stopgap measure if the software unexpectedly fails. 

## Definitions
Autonomous vehicles are defined to include SAE level 3 and above to create clear and concise legislation that promotes safety without interfering with current driving laws. Additionally, autonomous vehicle manufacturers include an individual or company that alters or modifies a traditional motor vehicle in addition to original equipment manufacturers. This allows companies to retrofit vehicles for testing promoting innovation in the state, while ensuring safe operation The unique aspects of autonomous vehicles requires “driving” to be redefined. The phrase “dynamic driving task” includes not only the traditional task of “driving” by human input but also technological input. There is additional clarification between the activator of the autonomous functionality and the operator who is in physical control. This clarification prevents confusion as to who is responsible for the vehicle and how that individual should be treated by traditional vehicle laws. The levels of automation are used to describe the distinctions between the different levels of automation, they start from level zero and progress step-wise to level five. The distinctions are taken from the Society for Automotive Engineers International J3016 standard. The levels describe the categorical difference and provide clear division to clarify which requirements will apply to which level of automation.

## Insurance [[TODO]]
- Administrative requirement for ridesharing requires $100,000 minimum insurance for the operator. We believe this should be sufficient for insurance for owners of autonomous vehicles without overburdening individuals. 

We divided the insurance regime into the following scenarios, with a delegation of additional regulatory authority to the appropriate agency.

1. The first regime is the individual who uses their vehicle only for private functions
    - This individual only requires the minimum state mandatory minimum for insurance
2. The second regime is the individual who privately owns a vehicle and also permits their vehicle to be used as part of a ride-sharing or similar scheme. 
    - This individual must carry insurance equal to $100,000 (the current minimum for commercial vehicle operaiton)
3. The third regime is the corporation that uses a private fleet (for employes only). 
    - the corporation must carry commercial vehicle insurance equal to the statutory mandatory minimum
4. The fourth and final regime is the corporation that uses a vehicle for public (taxi or ride-share) services or rental.
    - This regime must carry insurance equal to the minimum requirement for manufacturers as promulgated by the NHTSA or as designated by the appropriate state agency.


## Rebuttable Presumption [[TODO]]

This legislation package includes what we term a rebuttable presumption of manufacturer liability. The reason this was selected is because in most cases, the manufacturer will have all requisite control over the function of the vehicle without the intervening cause of a driver. However, the manufacturer should not be strictly liable because the owner of the vehicle will have certain reasonable maintenance requirements which they must follow. On a showing that the vehicle was properly maintained (in accordance with substantive requirements related to the cause of the accident), the manufacturer may be substituted for the owner / individual in physical control of the vehicle. 

This rebuttable presumption balances the need to give individuals incentives to maintain their vehicles in a responsible manner, and for manufacturers to produce safe vehicles, while making sure that people who are hurt by autonomous vehicles can rest assured that they will be able to recover against the appropriate party for their injuries. 


## Testing [[TODO]]

The testing regime is intended to give manufacturers reasonable testing standards for the operation of vehicles which have not yet been certified by the state, without unnecessarily restriciting the ability for potential upfitters to work within the state. The testing regime should be permissive enough to provide broad application of a test, while ensuring that they system meets minimum requirements. A combination of agency delegation along with a bare framework of statutory requirements offers the reassurance that individuals will need to know that a vehicle has met the minimum requirements for operation.

We divide the testing phase into three parts

1. Application for testing permit
2. Permit issuance
3. Testing operation

Penalties for violation are up to $25,000. 


## Recognition of Other States [[TODO]]

Other states will inevitably adopt measures for recognizing the efficacy of other testing regimes in other states. To the extent that the Department of Transportation or other appropriate state agency believes that the other state has assured the minimum sufficiency of other testing regimes, the state of Washington will give full faith and credit to the licensing of autonomous vehicles in such state for private operation. 

## Traffic Regulations [[TODO]]

Autonomous vehicles and their manufacturers should be given a reasonable degree of judgment with regard to the operation of a vehicle, especially in exigent circumstances. The traffic regulations and courts have offered some reasonable standard of deviation to human drivers, and the manufacturers should be held to that same judicial standard. 

At the same time, autonomous vehicles offer substantial benefits in the area of impaired driving, and should be permitted to provide security to users who wish to use autonomous capabilities while impaired rather than choosing to dangerously operate a vehicle manually.

### DUI [[TODO]]

DUIs should not apply to people occupying a vehicle that does not require user intervention (SAE level 4 or 5)

### Implied Consent [[TODO]]

A Userof a vehicle for which they will not engage in the "dynamic driving task" has not consented in the same way as an individual who has knowingly engaged in the dynamic driving task and by doing so subjected people to potential danger. 


## Privacy [[TODO]]

The privacy guidelines allow the industry to follow "best practices" which broadly means that the industry shall have significant discretion in this area, but may not be negligent in their management of personal data. Further, the privacy guidelinest require the availability of basic data for transparency matters, and also for individuals to have access to their own data as needed for their own security. The requirement that the information be accessible in a common file format just ensures that there will not be significant technical barriers to accessing the information. 

The Chief Privacy Officer is the agent of the state most capable of reviewing the sufficiency of the protections of consumer data. This agent should already have hte necessary contacts within the state and industry to make sure that the legislation meets the needs of the industry and the population at large.
