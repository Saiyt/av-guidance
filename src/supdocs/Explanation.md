# Executive Summary

The definitions used in the legislation mirror the definitions used by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in their autonomous vehicle policy. These definitions clarify terms used to describe autonomous vehicles and vehicle operators to avoid potential confusion with current driving legislation. Additionally, the levels of automation are defined according to the SAE International’s J3016 standard. These levels of automation describe categorical distinctions for a step-wise progress from level zero to level five automation.

Our bill includes a requirement for the DoL to maintain a database of SAE Level autonomous capabilities for vehicles registered in the state. This is to be indicated both on the vehicle’s yearly registration and license plate. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure drivers have ample notice of the capabilities (and limitations) of their vehicles, and provide general notice to others around the vehicles of their autonomous capabilities. Additionally, the Department of Licensing, Washington State Patrol, and Department of Transportation are collectively empowered to temporarily suspend an autonomous registration where a safety-critical vulnerability has been identified with a particular model, until such issue can be patched. This will ensure Washington residents can safely begin to take advantage of the benefits of autonomous transportation, while maintaining capabilities for a quick state response to any technological challenges.

To encourage safe technological innovation, our proposed testing regime is designed to promote public safety and responsible vehicle testing. Since vehicles currently tested by manufacturers are being operated and maintained by trained professionals, there are fewer requirements than if the vehicle is operated by the general public. Manufacturers will receive a testing permit upon submission of required documentation. Failure to adhere to parameters of issuance, or testing beyond that specified in the application (without amendment) is subject to fine or loss of testing license.


# Narrative Explanation
Autonomous vehicles will be entering the marketplace at an increasing pace. States such as Michigan and Florida have taken the lead by promulgating regulations which attempt to regulate an evolving market. It is conceivable that an autonomous vehicle manufacturer could operate in Washington without regulation, but in the face of potential litigation during testing phases, certainty provides a substantial incentive.

## Framework

In order to provide the reassurance sought by consumers and the certainty sought by manufacturers, the legislation seeks to meet the following objectives:

- Delegate to competent state agencies
- Provide a legal framework for unexpected developments in technology
- Update statutes which do not account for autonomous operation
- Except in matter which autonomous vehicles necessarily differ from standard vehicles, the standard regime should apply. 

## Exclusion of Mandatory Manual Override

We decided to exclude a mandatory manual override requirement from the general operation requirements, though kept the requirement of an override (software or physical) for testing. 

We decided to exclude a mandatory manual override for the following reasons:
- Requires software to know that it is missing something and "prove the negative"
- Questionable whether humans have the requisite reaction time to respond appropriately in such situations. 
- Does not permit people of limited mobility to make use of the technology.

Furthermore, vehicles of level 3 or lower have an incentive to include a manual override already because the technology cannot be operated in a wide variety of known conditions, such that the vehicle would not be useful without some form of manual control.

For testing purposes, an override makes sense because the actual automation software has not necessarily proven it's capacity for directing that specific type of vehicle. In the short term, a human operator may provide a necessary stopgap measure if the software unexpectedly fails. 

## Definitions
Autonomous vehicles are defined to include SAE level 3 and above to create clear and concise legislation that promotes safety without interfering with current driving laws. Additionally, autonomous vehicle manufacturers include an individual or company that alters or modifies a traditional motor vehicle in addition to original equipment manufacturers. This allows companies to retrofit vehicles for testing promoting innovation in the state, while ensuring safe operation The unique aspects of autonomous vehicles requires “driving” to be redefined. The phrase “dynamic driving task” includes not only the traditional task of “driving” by human input but also technological input. There is additional clarification between the activator of the autonomous functionality and the operator who is in physical control. This clarification prevents confusion as to who is responsible for the vehicle and how that individual should be treated by traditional vehicle laws. The levels of automation are used to describe the distinctions between the different levels of automation, they start from level zero and progress step-wise to level five. The distinctions are taken from the Society for Automotive Engineers International J3016 standard. The levels describe the categorical difference and provide clear division to clarify which requirements will apply to which level of automation.

## Registration

Similar to human-driven vehicles, we anticipate autonomous vehicles will be required to register with the Washington Department of Licensing (DoL). In addition to standard fields collected by DoL on registered vehicles, we propose the DoL maintain a database of autonomous vehicles sold to the public and their associated SAE level of autonomous capabilities (ex. SAE Level 4)[^saelevel]. This is the same standard being utilized by the U.S. Department of Transportation in autonomous vehicle planning.[^vehplan] This number will be published as a field on standard vehicle registration documentation to provide an additional layer of protection for consumers as to the autonomous capability level reported by the manufacturer based on hardware and software configuration. Since this number is subject to change with improved software updates, manufacturers are obligated to notify DoL when an increase in SAE level capability becomes available to the general public (ex. SAE Level 3 to Level 4). The purpose of this notification is to provide the DoL with ample opportunity to update their database, and in turn, the yearly registration sent to Washington motorists. Upon receipt of registration, Washington drivers must mark the registration in some manner indicating they understand their vehicle has autonomous capabilities. This requirement is to ensure motorists are informed of the capabilities (and limitations) of their vehicle.
	
In addition to registration requirements, the DoL is charged with developing a standard notation on Washington license plates to externally signify a vehicle is autonomous and the associated number. This is similar to license plates which designate existing non-standard vehicles classes (ex. Vehicle dealers).[^vehdeal] For example, autonomous license plates may start with a number signifying the SAE Level in an offset color (ex. A gold “4”). This requirement serves several purposes:
- Signify to pedestrians a vehicle is autonomous
- Signify to law enforcement a vehicle is autonomous, especially if driver  is using a cellular device or engaging in other behavior that would be unsafe in a human-driven vehicle
- License plate is more permanent, less aesthetically objectionable that a “sticker” or other forms of notice. (ex. carpool lane sticker)
	
While manufacturers have already completed millions of miles of testing, as with any technology, there will inevitably be issues that develop.[^muchtest] The Washington Department of Transportation, Washington State Patrol, and DoL License plate is more permanent, less aesthetically objectionable that a “sticker” or other forms of notice. (ex. carpool lane sticker) are delegated the authority to designate specific models of autonomous vehicles that temporarily may not be operated on Washington roads due to safety concerns until any issues can be addressed.

## Insurance [[TODO]]
- Administrative requirement for ridesharing requires $100,000 minimum insurance for the operator. We believe this should be sufficient for insurance for owners of autonomous vehicles without overburdening individuals. 

We divided the insurance regime into the following scenarios, with a delegation of additional regulatory authority to the appropriate agency.

1. The first regime is the individual who uses their vehicle only for private functions
    - This individual only requires the minimum state mandatory minimum for insurance
2. The second regime is the individual who privately owns a vehicle and also permits their vehicle to be used as part of a ride-sharing or similar scheme. 
    - This individual must carry insurance equal to $100,000 (the current minimum for commercial vehicle operaiton)
3. The third regime is the corporation that uses a private fleet (for employes only). 
    - the corporation must carry commercial vehicle insurance equal to the statutory mandatory minimum
4. The fourth and final regime is the corporation that uses a vehicle for public (taxi or ride-share) services or rental.
    - This regime must carry insurance equal to the minimum requirement for manufacturers as promulgated by the NHTSA or as designated by the appropriate state agency.


## Rebuttable Presumption [[TODO]]

This legislation package includes what we term a rebuttable presumption of manufacturer liability. The reason this was selected is because in most cases, the manufacturer will have all requisite control over the function of the vehicle without the intervening cause of a driver. However, the manufacturer should not be strictly liable because the owner of the vehicle will have certain reasonable maintenance requirements which they must follow. On a showing that the vehicle was properly maintained (in accordance with substantive requirements related to the cause of the accident), the manufacturer may be substituted for the owner / individual in physical control of the vehicle. 

This rebuttable presumption balances the need to give individuals incentives to maintain their vehicles in a responsible manner, and for manufacturers to produce safe vehicles, while making sure that people who are hurt by autonomous vehicles can rest assured that they will be able to recover against the appropriate party for their injuries. 


## Testing 
While the public can already purchase vehicles equipped with semi-autonomous features, over 30 manufacturers are still largely in the “testing” phase of development as the industry moves towards a fully autonomous vehicle (SAE Level 5)[^features]. This presents an opportunity for Washington to become an industry leader with prompt, commercially accommodatable legislation, while improving the safety of these future vehicles for Washington residents. The unique climate of Washington relative to other major hubs of autonomous vehicle testing (i.e. California, Michigan, etc.) makes it especially beneficial to the people of Washington to encourage manufacturers to bring their testing here.[^otherstatetest] Prompt testing will improve the adeptness to the vehicles operating in Washington through improved familiarity and experience with Washington weather, terrain, and infrastructure.[^whywash] The testing regulations are divided into 3 parts: 1) application for a testing permit, 2) permit issuance, and 3) testing operation.

### 1. Application for a Testing Permit
The application for a testing permit will ensure the State of Washington is aware of autonomous vehicles being operated within the state. In order to receive a license to test, a manufacturer must submit an 8-field application to the Department of Licensing. These requirements are meant to serve specific public interests, such as: a point of contact for the manufacturer, road safety plan, privacy policy, compliance with minimum federal roadworthiness standards, and evidence of adequate insurance. A “permit” is a common requirement in other states allowing vehicle testing.[^permit]

[^permit]: http://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/autonomous-vehicles-legislation.aspx

### 2. Permit Issuance
Rather than evaluating the technological adequacy of autonomous test vehicles, the purpose of DoL submission and review is to ensure the operational thoughtfulness and accountability of the testing manufacturer. Upon receipt of a properly filed permit application, the DoL will inform the Washington State Patrol and Chief Privacy Officer of the application to ensure the awareness of other critical areas of government related to autonomous vehicle testing. The DoL will issue a permit to each vehicle to be tested. This testing permit is an additional requirement to normal registration procedures, meaning any test vehicle must satisfy the standard registration requirements of a normal (human-operated) vehicle to test on public roadways.[^testroads]

[^testroads]: http://www.dol.wa.gov/vehicleregistration/registervehicle.html

### 3. Operation Under Testing License
A testing license only grants manufacturers the right to test their vehicle under the supervision of an employee or contractor, and does not allow for use by the general public. Operational policies balance the need for manufacturers to test their autonomous technologies in real-world conditions, while ensuring a human backup to maintain safety of the public. Additionally, manufacturers must specify in their license, or through an amendment, the exact range of capabilities and geographic regions in which they intend to test. This will ensure the public can be notified prior to the use of testing vehicles in their neighborhood. In the event a manufacturer operates without a testing license or goes beyond the scope of their license, the DoL is empowered to fine that manufacturer relative to the severity of non-compliance.


## Recognition of Other States [[TODO]]

Other states will inevitably adopt measures for recognizing the efficacy of other testing regimes in other states. To the extent that the Department of Transportation or other appropriate state agency believes that the other state has assured the minimum sufficiency of other testing regimes, the state of Washington will give full faith and credit to the licensing of autonomous vehicles in such state for private operation. 

## Traffic Regulations [[TODO]]

Autonomous vehicles and their manufacturers should be given a reasonable degree of judgment with regard to the operation of a vehicle, especially in exigent circumstances. The traffic regulations and courts have offered some reasonable standard of deviation to human drivers, and the manufacturers should be held to that same judicial standard. 

At the same time, autonomous vehicles offer substantial benefits in the area of impaired driving, and should be permitted to provide security to users who wish to use autonomous capabilities while impaired rather than choosing to dangerously operate a vehicle manually.

### DUI [[TODO]]

DUIs should not apply to people occupying a vehicle that does not require user intervention (SAE level 4 or 5)

### Implied Consent [[TODO]]

A Userof a vehicle for which they will not engage in the "dynamic driving task" has not consented in the same way as an individual who has knowingly engaged in the dynamic driving task and by doing so subjected people to potential danger. 


## Privacy [[TODO]]

The privacy guidelines allow the industry to follow "best practices" which broadly means that the industry shall have significant discretion in this area, but may not be negligent in their management of personal data. Further, the privacy guidelinest require the availability of basic data for transparency matters, and also for individuals to have access to their own data as needed for their own security. The requirement that the information be accessible in a common file format just ensures that there will not be significant technical barriers to accessing the information. 

The Chief Privacy Officer is the agent of the state most capable of reviewing the sufficiency of the protections of consumer data. This agent should already have hte necessary contacts within the state and industry to make sure that the legislation meets the needs of the industry and the population at large.
