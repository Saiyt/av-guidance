# Executive Summary

Where possible, this legislation borrows from subject matter experts, using definitions proposed by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) to provide a robust framework for Washington Law that fits with existing literature. For the purposes of regulation, autonomous vehicle technology is classified into five categories that mirror national standards. 

The bill treats the Department of Licensing (DOL) as the primary interface between consumers, government, and manufacturers in order to ensure a consistent, statewide system for understanding new technology as it emerges. Where the DOL does not have expertise, the DOL should work with the Committee for Autonomous Technologies and Cybersecurity (CyberCATS), which is also introduced in the bill. 

CyberCATS will be required to study and begin an aggressive research campaign into the effects of autonomous technologies, including key stakeholders across the government and industry. This committee should form the basis for information sharing and preparation for future developments in the autonomous transportation field. 

To encourage safe technological innovation, our proposed testing regime promotes public safety and responsible vehicle testing. Manufacturers will receive a testing permit upon submission of required documentation. Failure to adhere to parameters of issuance, or testing beyond that specified in the application (without amendment) is subject to fine or loss of testing license.

The bill further reinforces privacy protections for users of autonomous vehicles and preserves Washington's reputation as a stalwart protector of consumer privacy. With our proposal, the user will know exactly what data will be collected and will have access to data in case of an accident. In addition, data management limitations, data security, and de-identification of personal data policies are introduced. The purpose is to advance transparency, accountability values, and ultimately, consumers’ trust in autonomous vehicles. 

# Narrative Explanation
Autonomous vehicles will be entering the marketplace at an increasing pace. States such as Michigan and Florida have taken steps to provide safety and surety to consumers and manufacturers of vehicles in Washington. 

## Framework

In order to provide the reassurance sought by consumers and manufacturers, the legislation seeks to meet the following objectives:

- Delegate to competent state agencies
- Provide a legal framework for unexpected developments in technology
- Update statutes which do not account for autonomous operation

## Exclusion of Mandatory Manual Override

We decided to exclude a mandatory manual override requirement from the general operation requirements, though kept the requirement of an override (software or physical) for testing. 

We decided to exclude a mandatory manual override for the following reasons:
- Requires software to know that it is missing something and "prove the negative"
- Questionable whether humans have the requisite reaction time to respond appropriately in such situations. 
- Does not permit people of limited mobility to make use of the technology.

Furthermore, vehicles which fall below an autonomy level of four have an incentive to include a manual override already because the technology cannot be operated in a wide variety of known conditions, such that the vehicle would not be useful without some form of manual control.

For testing purposes, an override makes sense because the actual automation software has not necessarily proven it's capacity for directing that specific type of vehicle. In the short term, a human operator may provide a necessary stopgap measure if the software unexpectedly fails. 

## Definitions
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has elected to rely on the standards established by the Society of Automotive Engineers. Following the 5 level standard, a vehicle of Level Three or higher can operate in what people commonly refer to as "autonomously." Vehicles currently on the road with advanced lane correction and automatic emergency braking are considered "Level Two," while the most advanced driverless vehicles which are commercially available straddle the line between levels two and three. Current predictions suggest that fully autonomous vehicles (Level Four,those which won't require human intervention in most situations) may be available as early as 2020. This bill reconciles the common perceptions with the technical standards to provide legislators with a framework for effectively approaching autonomous technology. 

The unique aspects of autonomous vehicles requires “driving” to be redefined. The phrase “dynamic driving task” includes not only the traditional task of “driving” by human input but also technological input. There is additional clarification between the activator of the autonomous functionality and the operator who is in physical control. This clarification prevents confusion as to who is responsible for the vehicle and how that individual should be treated by the current motor vehicle laws. 

## Registration

Similar to human-driven vehicles, we autonomous vehicles owners will register with the Washington Department of Licensing (DOL). In addition to standard fields collected by DOL on registered vehicles, we propose the DOL maintain a database of autonomous vehicles sold to the public and their associated SAE level of autonomous capabilities[^saelevel]. This is the same standard being utilized by the U.S. Department of Transportation in autonomous vehicle planning.[^vehplan] The level of automation should be published as a field on standard vehicle registration documentation to provide additional informatin to consumers who may not be in a position to evaluate the autonomous capability level reported by the manufacturer based on hardware and software configuration. Since this number is subject to change with improved software updates, manufacturers are obligated to notify the DOL when an increase in capability becomes available to the general public (ex. a change in capacity from Level 3 to Level 4). The purpose of this notification is to provide the DOL with ample opportunity to update their database, and in turn, the yearly registration sent to Washington motorists. Upon receipt of registration, Washington drivers must mark the registration in some manner indicating they understand their vehicle has autonomous capabilities. This requirement is to ensure motorists are informed of the capabilities (and limitations) of their vehicle.
	
In addition to registration requirements, the DOL is charged with developing a standard notation on Washington license plates to externally signify a vehicle is autonomous and the associated number. This is similar to license plates which designate existing non-standard vehicles classes (ex. Vehicle dealers).[^vehdeal] For example, autonomous license plates may start with a number signifying the SAE Level in an offset color (ex. A gold “4”). This requirement serves several purposes:
- Signify to pedestrians a vehicle is autonomous
- Signify to law enforcement a vehicle is autonomous, especially if driver  is using a cellular device or engaging in other behavior that would be unsafe in a human-driven vehicle
- License plate is more permanent and les aesthetically objectionable than a sticker.
	
While manufacturers have already completed millions of miles of testing, as with any technology, there will inevitably be issues that develop.[^muchtest] The Washington Department of Transportation, Washington State Patrol, and DOL License plate is more permanent, less aesthetically objectionable that a “sticker” or other forms of notice. (ex. carpool lane sticker) are delegated the authority to designate specific models of autonomous vehicles that temporarily may not be operated on Washington roads due to safety concerns until any issues can be addressed.

## Insurance
The insurance provisions make explicit the different uses for autonomous vehicles by providing broad language to cover four primary groups of users. The actual amounts for insurance mirror the current requirements for insurance for personal or business use in Washington State, using transportation network company insurance guidelines in Seattle as a model for insurance amounts required for the transportation network companies using autonomous vehicles. Related or new models of business could require additional legislation, though the current provisions cover anticipated business models. 

We explicitly divided the insurance into the following logical groups. 

1. The first category is the individual who uses their vehicle only for private functions
    - This individual only requires the minimum state mandatory minimum for insurance
2. The second category is the individual who privately owns a vehicle and also permits their vehicle to be used as part of a ride-sharing or similar scheme.
    - This individual must carry insurance equal to $100,000 (the current minimum for commercial vehicle operaiton)
3. The third category is the corporation that uses a private fleet (for employes only). 
    - the corporation must carry commercial vehicle insurance equal to the statutory mandatory minimum
4. The fourth and final category is the corporation that uses a vehicle for public (taxi or ride-share) services or rental.
    - This category must carry insurance equal to the minimum requirement for manufacturers as promulgated by the NHTSA or as designated by the appropriate state agency.


## Civil Liability

The civil liability framework envisioned by the legislation seeks to
answer a fundamental question of autonomous vehicles: if it gets into an
accident, whose fault is it? Traditional auto liability regimes
typically seek to determine which of the drivers involved in the crash
was responsible for it. If one of those drivers is a piece of software
operating various hardware autonomously, that question becomes much more
complex.

The bill proposes that Washington State adopt a novel and
forward-looking liability scheme that allows the manufacturer of the AV
system to be joined to an auto liability suit, provided that certain
preconditions are met. This approach offers a way to account for the
fact that the passenger who activates the system surrenders control of
the vehicle and thus shouldn’t be held accountable for any mistakes the
system may make.[^1] Upon showing that the system was properly
maintained and engaged at the time of the incident, the “activator” is
excused from liability and the manufacturer added. The court would then
proceed with a rebuttal presumption that the manufacturer is the liable
party. This presumption can then be rebutted by a showing that *either
the other party was the true cause of the accident or that* the
manufacturer took reasonable care to ensure crash avoidance and human
safety and did a reasonable job of ensuring the safe operation by the
consumer. *If the other party was a proximate cause, the court will
apportion blame between the manufacturer and the other driver.* *If the
manufacturer makes such a showing, the court will treat the matter as a
no-fault accident and excuse the manufacturer from the case. *

These provisions achieve three goals. First, they excuse from liability
the passenger who, although they activated the system, were not in
physical control of the vehicle at the time of the incident. Second, it
streamlines the products liability framework that would undoubtedly
arise through the common law in the absence of action by the
legislature. Finally, it creates a market incentive for AV manufacturers
to take care to ensure not just crash worthiness, but crash avoidance.
The resulting regime is one that incentivizes safety and creates
assurance that irresponsible actors will be held accountable.

## Testing 
While the public can already purchase vehicles equipped with semi-autonomous features, over 30 manufacturers are still largely in the “testing” phase of development as the industry moves towards a fully autonomous vehicle (SAE Level 5)[^features]. This presents an opportunity for Washington to become an industry leader with prompt, commercially accommodatable legislation, while improving the safety of these future vehicles for Washington residents. The unique climate of Washington relative to other major hubs of autonomous vehicle testing (i.e. California, Michigan, etc.) makes it especially beneficial to the people of Washington to encourage manufacturers to bring their testing here.[^otherstatetest] Prompt testing will improve the adeptness to the vehicles operating in Washington through improved familiarity and experience with Washington weather, terrain, and infrastructure.[^whywash] The testing regulations are divided into 3 parts: 1) application for a testing permit, 2) permit issuance, and 3) testing operation.

### 1. Application for a Testing Permit
The application for a testing permit will ensure the State of Washington is aware of autonomous vehicles being operated within the state. In order to receive a license to test, a manufacturer must submit an 8-field application to the Department of Licensing. These requirements are meant to serve specific public interests, such as: a point of contact for the manufacturer, road safety plan, privacy policy, compliance with minimum federal roadworthiness standards, and evidence of adequate insurance. A “permit” is a common requirement in other states allowing vehicle testing.[^permit]

[^permit]: http://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/autonomous-vehicles-legislation.aspx

### 2. Permit Issuance
Rather than evaluating the technological adequacy of autonomous test vehicles, the purpose of DOL submission and review is to ensure the operational thoughtfulness and accountability of the testing manufacturer. Upon receipt of a properly filed permit application, the DOL will inform the Washington State Patrol and Chief Privacy Officer of Washington State of the application to ensure the awareness of other critical areas of government related to autonomous vehicle testing. The DOL will issue a permit to each vehicle to be tested. This testing permit is an additional requirement to normal registration procedures, meaning any test vehicle must satisfy the standard registration requirements of a normal (human-operated) vehicle to test on public roadways.[^testroads]

### 3. Operation Under Testing License
A testing license only grants manufacturers the right to test their vehicle under the supervision of an employee or contractor, and does not allow for use by the general public. Operational policies balance the need for manufacturers to test their autonomous technologies in real-world conditions, while ensuring a human backup to maintain safety of the public. Additionally, manufacturers must specify in their license, or through an amendment, the exact range of capabilities and geographic regions in which they intend to test. This will ensure the public can be notified prior to the use of testing vehicles in their neighborhood. In the event a manufacturer operates without a testing license or goes beyond the scope of their license, the DOL is empowered to fine that manufacturer relative to the severity of non-compliance.


## Recognition of Other States

Autonomous vehicles licensed in other states should be able to drive into Washington without problem. Autonomous vehicles owned by state residents must be registered with the Department of Licensing, which will give the state effective notice concerning the makes and models of vehicles with autonomous capacities.

## Traffic Regulations

Autonomous vehicles and their manufacturers should be given a reasonable degree of judgment with regard to the operation of a vehicle, especially in exigent circumstances. The traffic regulations and courts have offered some reasonable standard of deviation to human drivers, and the manufacturers should be held to that same judicial standard. 

## DUI and Implied Consent

Driving Under the Influence (DUI) should not apply to people occupying a vehicle that does not require user intervention (SAE level 4 or 5). A level three vehicle may require an activator to resume the dynamic driving task, and therefore should not permit people to drive under the influence. 

The primary justifications and motivations behind an implied consent law for mandatory alcohol and drug testing are removed with a vehicle capable of all aspects of the dynamic driving task.


## Privacy

In the Bill there is a special consideration for privacy policy in AV, because the existing measures could not be protective enough for personal data AV treatment.

In today’s privacy legislation, personal data in AV would be generally protected when the AV company promised to protect these data in its privacy notice but instead deceived the user in doing so (FTC Act, Section 5). Thus, a preexisting privacy notice from the company is needed to activate this privacy protection. Otherwise, the AV’s user could only rely on few protections limited to specific types of data (financial and health related), leaving poorly covered many others.  

Our proposal builds on this need, and mirrors the protections of the Washington Administrative Code 284-04 for consumer financial and health information. It also construes over the Privacy recommendations of the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy (NHTSA September 2016).

With the proposed Bill, the AV’s user will know exactly what data and for what purposes is being collected, will be notified when a major data breach takes place, and will be able to access AV data in case of an accident. In addition, the Bill limits the amount of data collected and the storage time to the minimum necessary, introduces data security, and encourages de-identification of personal data. Thus, the AV’s company will have to build a privacy policy and notice to its users and so, be now visible for the FTC in case of deceptive or unfair acts related to it, advancing transparency, accountability, and ultimately, consumers’ trust in AVs.

## Creation of a New Committee

The bill creates the Committee for Autonomous Technologies, Safety, and Cybersecurity (CyberCATS). CyberCATS has a dual purpose. On the one hand, it serves as a means to coordinate the different departments and actors that may be involved in the safe deployment of AV, including not only governmental agents but industry. On the other hand, CyberCATS will be in charge of reviewing the sufficiency of existing law and producing recommendations that would guide the transition from the traditional transportation system to an advanced mobility system, specifically focusing on AV technologies. The creation of CyberCATS coincides with the recommendations of the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy (NHTSA September 2016), for state policy model.

# Conclusion
An early and effective public policy response will position Washington as a valuable partner as companies develop the next generation of transportation technologies. Washington has the chance to address the challenges of autonomous vehicle in calm waters before a crisis event which could spur reactionary models that overly burden innovative new technologies.
