# NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. Definitions
The following definitions shall apply to all sections within this chapter.

1. Autonomous Vehicle - A motor vehicle that is equipped with a self-driving system. Any vehicle at or exceeding level three as established by this chapter shall qualify as an autonomous vehicle. 
2. Self-driving system - Artificial Intelligence system that is capable of functioning under conditions which require it to engage in the dynamic driving task. 
3. Autonomous Vehicle Manufacturer – Any individual or company that develops autonomous vehicles for testing or deployment purposes on public roadways; this shall include original equipment manufacturers, alterers, or modifiers.
4. Other Autonomous Vehicle Entity – is any individual or company that is not a manufacturer and is involved in any activity related to the manufacturing, testing, operation, selling, or renting of an autonomous vehicle.
5. Dynamic Driving Task - Use of sensory and motive capacity to engage, direct, and control a vehicle whether through the use of eyes, hands, or technological means. 
6. Activator - Individual who activates the automated vehicle functionality.
7. Operator or driver - Every person who drives or is in actual physical control of a vehicle provided that any vehicle whose self-driving system is rated as level four or higher and is properly engaged, the self-driving system shall be the driver and the self-driving system shall be considered the operator or driver of the vehicle.

## Levels of Automation

1.  Level Zero Automation - the full-time performance by the human driver of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, even when enhanced by warning or intervention systems
2.  Level One Automation - the driving mode-specific execution by a driver assistance system of either steering or acceleration/deceleration using information about the driving environment and with the expectation that the human driver perform all remaining aspects of the dynamic driving task
3.  Level Two Automation - the driving mode-specific execution by one or more driver assistance systems of both steering and acceleration/ deceleration using information about the driving environment and with the expectation that the human driver perform all remaining aspects of the dynamic driving task
4. Level Three Automation - the driving mode-specific performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task with the expectation that the human driver will respond appropriately to a request to intervene
5.  Level Four Automation - the driving mode-specific performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, even if a human driver does not respond appropriately to a request to intervene
6.  Level Five Automation - the full-time performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task under all roadway and environmental conditions that can be managed by a human driver
