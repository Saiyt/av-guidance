**The Committee.** The Transportation Commission will create and launch the “Committee for Autonomous Technologies Safety and Cybersecurity” (CyberCATS). The Committee shall include representatives from the Office of the Governor, the Department of Licensing, the State Department of Transportation, the Washington State Patrol, Washington Traffic Safety Commission, the Office of the Chief Information Officer, Washington State Office of the Insurance Commissioner, Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, tolling and transit authorities from the Washington Department of Transportation, among other representatives necessary for coordinating the testing and operating activities of the autonomous technology. CyberCATS should consult with representatives from related industries at regular intervals. 

**Information.** The Department of Licensing will inform the CyberCATS about the requests received to test autonomous vehicles and the status of the Department’s responses to them.
Data testing requirements. The Department of Licensing will define with the CyberCATS the necessary data from the entity to register an autonomous vehicle in Washington State. 

**Scope and Purpose**
Review of existing laws. CyberCATS will review main statutes to identify any legal issues that need to be addressed prior to the deployment and operation of automated vehicles and to ensure safe testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles. In particular, but not limited to, the licensing and registration procedures; driver information and training; the insurance and liability rules as well as the enforcement of traffic laws and motor vehicle inspections; requirements and needs of law enforcement related to autonomous vehicles; and whether a preclearance regime for the operation of autonomous vehicles should be adopted by Washington State. 

CyberCATS shall produce the following recommendations in consultation with the state agency or agencies having the most direct oversight of such subject matter:

1. Employment impacts, including taxi and long-haul truck driving
2. Environmental effects of autonomous vehicles and related changes in vehicle use patterns
3. How AVs will impact traffic and public transit
4. Necessary infrastructure upgrades and improvements to safety that can be achieved through public - private partnerships
5. The impact of autonomous vehicles on disadvantaged populations including what changes may be made to improve access for disabled and indigent populations. 
 
After completion of the preceding reports, CyberCATS may review, consult, or provide recommendations which bear on the use of autonomous vehicles in Washington State at its discretion.


**Timing**
The recommendations explicitly listed in this chapter shall be produced and presented to the legislature within one year of the effective date of this chapter. In the event that any report may not be completed within one year, the committee may extend the completion of the report in one year intervals, but not before making an interrim recommendation.   

**Additional Tasks**
At regular intervals, CyberCATS shall evaluate and determine additional related studies which need to be carried out for the effective administration of autonomous vehicles.
