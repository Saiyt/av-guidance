# NEW SECTION Sec. 7 Privacy

The manufacturer must submit to the Department of Licensing a report detailing the company's efforts to protect consumer privacy. At any time the manufacturer makes a material change in the privacy policy, such policy shall be resubmitted to the Department of Licensing.

Manufacturers' privacy and data policy shall include at least the following provisions or their equivalent:

1. User Notice and Consent - provide users with clear notification indicating the types of information collected, what information is shared, and instructions on how to modify privacy settings. Written consent and acknowledgement shall be collected.
2. Data Security - implement hardware and software privacy protections at a level consistent with industry standards. Access to data shall be restricted only to such personnel necessary for providing the services specified by the manufacturer. 
3. 3rd Party Data Sharing and accountability - Any third party using data collected through the use of an autonomous vehicle must comply with the substantive provisions of the manufacturer's privacy policy. 
4.  Contextual Use - the manufacturer must notify the end user of any additional uses not related to the provision of automated driving functionality. 
5.  User Choice - provide users with meaningful opportunity to use the automated vehicle in a "basic" operation mode which minimizes data collection.

The record shall be provided in a non-proprietary format within a reasonable time frame after a request by a vehicle owner, activator, or law enforcement officer makes such request. 
8.  Data Management Limitations – notice of data reduction policies, including, but not limited to, time periods for which certain classes or types of data will no longer be retained.
