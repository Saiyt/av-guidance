**Justification**

Autonomous vehicles will be entering the marketplace at an increasing pace. States such as Michigan and Florida have taken the lead by promulgating regulations which attempt to regulate an evolving market. It is conceivable that an autonomous vehicle manufacturer could operate in Washington without regulation, but in the face of potential litigation during testing phases, certainty provides a substantial incentive.

**Framework**

In order to provide the reassurance sought by consumers and the certainty sought by manufacturers, the legislation seeks to meet the following objectives:

- Delegate to competent state agencies
- Provide a legal framework for unexpected developments in technology
- Update statutes which do not account for autonomous operation
