# NEW SECTION Definitions
The following definitions shall apply to all sections within this chapter.


- Autonomous Vehicle - A motor vehicle that is equipped with a self-driving system. Any vehicle at or exceeding - Level Three as established by the Society of American Engineers shall qualify as an autonomous vehicle. 
- Self-driving system - Artificial Intelligence system that is capable of functioning under conditions which require it to engage in the dynamic driving task. 
- Testing - Driving of an autonomous vehicle under supervision of a human operator that can take control of the vehicle immediately, manually or remotely.
- Autonomous Vehicle Manufacturer – Any individual or company that develops autonomous vehicles for testing or deployment purposes on public roadways; this shall include original equipment manufacturers, alterers, or modifiers;  
- Other Autonomous Vehicle Entity – is any individual or company that is not a manufacturer and is involved in any activity related to the manufacturing, testing, operation, selling, or renting of an autonomous vehicle
- Dynamic Driving Task - Use of sensory and motive capacity to engage, direct, and control a vehicle whether through the use of eyes, hands, or technological means. 
- Activator - Individual who activates the automated vehicle functionality
- "Operator or driver" means every person who drives or is in actual physical control of a vehicle provided that in regard to any vehicle whose self-driving system is rated as level four or higher and is properly engaged, the self-driving system shall be the driver and the self-driving system shall be considered the operator or driver of the vehicle.

## Levels of Automation

- Level Zero Autonomous Vehicle - the full-time performance by the human driver of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, even when enhanced by warning or intervention systems
- Level One Autonomous Vehicle - the driving mode-specific execution by a driver assistance system of either steering or acceleration/deceleration using information about the driving environment and with the expectation that the human driver perform all remaining aspects of the dynamic driving task
- Level Two Autonomous Vehicle - the driving mode-specific execution by one or more driver assistance systems of both steering and acceleration/ deceleration using information about the driving environment and with the expectation that the human driver perform all remaining aspects of the dynamic driving task
- Level Three Autonomous Vehicle - the driving mode-specific performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task with the expectation that the human driver will respond appropriately to a request to intervene
- Level Four Autonomous Vehicle - the driving mode-specific performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, even if a human driver does not respond appropriately to a request to intervene
- Level Five Autonomous Vehicle - the full-time performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task under all roadway and environmental conditions that can be managed by a human driver
