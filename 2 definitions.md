The following definitions shall apply to all sections within this chapter.

- **Levels of Autonomy** - 

- **Autonomous Vehicle** - A motor vehicle which is equipped with a self-driving system. Any vehicle at or exceeding Level Three as established by the Society of American Engineers shall qualify as an autonomous vehicle. 
- **Self-driving system** - Artificial Intelligence system which is capable of functioning under conditions which require it to engage in the dynamic driving task. 
- **Driver** - Any person who engages a level 4 or higher AV capability shall not be considered a 'driver', 'operator', or 'in control of a vehicle'. Any person who engages a level 3 autonomous vehicle shall still be considered to be a driver, but only to the extent which they must be capable of resuming the dynamic driving task in situations for which the level 3 autonomous vehicle cannot sufficiently carry out the dynamic driving task. 
- **Operator** - Individual who engages the automated vehicle functionality
- **Testing** - Driving of an autonomous vehicle under supervision of a human operator that can take control of the vehicle immediately, manually or remotely.
- **Manufacturer** - A person or entity that has manufactured and distributed motor vehicles in the United States that is certified to comply with all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and that has submitted appropriate Manufacturer identification information to the NHTSA as provided in 49 CFR section 566. 
- **Upfitter** - An entity or person that modifies a motor vehicle after it was manufactured by installing a self-driving system in that motor vehicle to convert it to an autonomous vehicle
- **Physical Control** - as defined in the RCW
- **Dynamic Driving Task** - Use of sensory and motive capacity to engage, direct, and control a vehicle  whether through the use of eyes, hands, or technological means.
