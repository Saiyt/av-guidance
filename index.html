<p>Set of legislative principles that recommend best practices for the regulation of autonomous vehicles. 
Any set of information published here is considered "stable" or definitions that are both <em>reviewed and consistent</em>. </p>

<p>Issues, concerns, and questions should be raised in the issue tracker: <a href="https://github.com/Saiyt/av-guidance/issues">https://github.com/Saiyt/av-guidance/issues</a></p>

<p>GitHub uses the concept of <em>branches</em> to differentiate between different qualities of work. Our project will have two branches: <a href="https://github.com/Saiyt/av-guidance/tree/development">development</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Saiyt/av-guidance/">master</a>. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Development represents the guidance that has not been reviewed by other members of the group. I will post changes to the development branch and merge them into the master branch. These should be considered "first draft." </p></li>
<li><p>Master represents our "final" draft, or at least the draft that the group agrees is representative of our work product and is ready for general consumption.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to learn a new technology I'm happy to give you a quick tutorial and you're welcome to submit pull requests directly, otherwise don't worry about it. Just send your drafts to me directly and I'll take care of the administrative details. I know that this might seem a bit excessive. I believe that there are two major advantages to this approach. The first is that a great number of open source projects use these processes to manage complex details. Second, this process will give us a rich history of the work so that we can revert, change, and comment on each detail independently to promote a better finished project. </p>

<p>Thank you everyone for your hard work, I think this will go great!</p>
