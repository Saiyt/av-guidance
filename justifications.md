**Mandatory Manual Override**
- Requires software to knowt that it is missing something and "prove the negative"
- Questionable whether humans have the requisite reaction time to respond appropriately in such situations. 
- Does not permit people of limited mobility. 

**Insurance Amount**
- Administrative requirement for Lyft and Uber requires $100,000 minimum insurance for the operator. We believe this should be sufficient for insurance for owners of autonomous vehicles without overburdening individuals.
