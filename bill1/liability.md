# NEW SECTION Liability
For any civil claim arising out of an accident or collision involving an autonomous vehicle registered as level 3 or greater, the activator and any passenger may be excused from civil liability and the autonomous vehicle manufacturer joined as a party upon a showing by any party that:

1. the autonomous functionality of the vehicle was properly engaged at the time of the accident or collision; and
2. the owner of the autonomous vehicle reasonably maintained the vehicle in accordance with relevant state law and manufacturer guidelines.

Once such a showing has been made, the presiding court shall adopt a rebuttable presumption that the self-driving system was the proximate cause of the accident.  

This presumption shall be rebuttable upon a showing that:

1.  the self-driving system was designed and built in accordance with reasonable measures to ensure crash avoidance and minimization of harm to human life and safety; and
2.  the autonomous vehicle manufacturer was reasonably prudent in ensuring the safe operation of its vehicle by consumers
